# API examples

This folder contains the examples of using PetIBM API to build flow solvers.
The solvers provided in this folder are just for demonstration purpose. While
they may still be used to conduct flow simulations, their functionalities are 
limited.

The solvers with more complete features can be found in the application
folder under PetIBM source folder. And their executable binary can be found in 
*bin* folder after building and installing PetIBM.

The basic example is the Navier-Stokes solver in the `liddrivencavity2d`. And
in `oscillatingcylinder2dRe100_GPU` is the solver solving the flow over
an oscillating cylinder in 2D and using GPU.
