Welcome to the [PetIBM](https://github.com/barbagroup/PetIBM) wiki!

PetIBM solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two and three dimensions using the immersed boundary projection method from [Taira and Colonius](http://colonius.caltech.edu/pdfs/TairaColonius2007.pdf) (2007) and is implemented using PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation.
