Welcome to the [PetIBM](https://github.com/barbagroup/PetIBM) wiki!


PetIBM implements immersed-boundary methods to solve the 2D and 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes on structured Cartesian grids using a projection approach.

Two immersed boundary methods are implemented:

* Immersed Boundary Projection Method (IBPM; Taira and Colonius, 2007);
* decoupled version of the IBPM (Li et al., 2016).
