# PetIBM - A PETSc-based Immersed Boundary Method code

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/barbagroup/PetIBM.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/barbagroup/PetIBM)

PetIBM solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two and three dimensions using the immersed boundary projection method from [Taira and Colonius](http://colonius.caltech.edu/pdfs/TairaColonius2007.pdf) (2007) and is implemented using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/), the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation.
